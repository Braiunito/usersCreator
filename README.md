# Make Users


This is a project in full PHP and JS, without frameworks, all coded "by hand". And mounted in heroku with Amazon RDS as DB provider.
The link of the heroku app is [Click me to start make users!](https://make-users.herokuapp.com/).

The entry point of the aplication is the ```index.pxp``` file located at ```public/index.php```.
That calls ```app.php``` in ```public/libs/app.php```.

This application was built in a span of 5 hours per day from October 27 to November 4.
Was a challenge and was a success just working a total of 35Hs.

Most of the time was spent on define and develop the main structure or MVC pattern and tools (Core functions) to start the real development-app-work.
